### Description

This is the 3rd release of Winstartup Manager and it's (v 1.2). As the name says it manage all startup items in registry "Run" sections that usually executed when you reach your windows desktop. This version has been enhanced more to be user friendly as well as the registry key sections has been fixed from the image list to option boxes and added some nice features in the upper menus, check them yourself please and if its desire voting will be appriciated thank you .

I will say thanks a lot for the following cool people out there that reminded and comment me for the previous version 1.2 that has some bugs in the optionbox control regarding the "selregentry" var .
